            There are 2 types of website normally -
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Static Website Designing: </b> If you just want to have a website with details about your company and
            products / services then this is simple and good option. In static website also you have two options one is
            template based website and other is completely customized designed website. Template based website is ready
            to use design in which logo, content, links and images are changed, but the layout of website is not
            changed. Such website are fast to deliver and economical in cost. Second is completely customized website,
            in this our web designers work on your website right from the scratch and do completely unique design. Such
            website cost is higher than template based and takes longer time to complete, but such websites look are
            totally as per clients requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dynamic Website Designing &amp; Development: </b> If you have more products / services to be displayed on
            website or you want to manage the web pages by your own, then you are actually looking for a dynamic
            website. When we say a dynamic website then it has a customized design and a CMS program to manage the web
            pages. Such website are also known as CMS websites, in which admin can manage the whole website from admin
            panel.
